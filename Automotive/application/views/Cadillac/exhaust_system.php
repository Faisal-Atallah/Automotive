                    <p>The Cadillac exhaust system is designed to efficiently remove the waste products produced by combustion from the engine,
                        helping to keep the engine performing at its best.
                        The process of engine combustion produces a wave of intense sound and hot exhaust gasses that contain several poisonous chemicals.
                        These factors make it necessary for the exhaust emissions to be processed before being released into the air in order to minimize the both air and noise pollution produced by the vehicle.
                        The Cadillac exhaust system reduces the noise of engine combustion,
                        which would be incredibly loud if released freely into the air, as well as reducing the hazardous chemicals emitted by the vehicle.
                        The Cadillac exhaust system performs these valuable functions by passing the sound wave and exhaust gasses through a series of components that each complete a step in the process.
                        The exhaust manifold is the first component in line, collecting the exhaust as it leaves the engine cylinders and directing it through to the rest of the Cadillac exhaust system.
                        The exhaust fumes and noise then pass through the catalytic converter, which removes a great deal of the poisonous chemicals that they carry.
                        The exhaust then passes through the muffler,
                        which is designed to reduce the noise of the engine with several sound reducing methods.From the muffler, the exhaust passes to the tailpipe and is released into the air,
                        with a greatly reduced level of noise and harmful chemicals to affect our environment.
