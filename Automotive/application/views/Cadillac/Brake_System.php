                    <h3>UNDERSTANDING WHEN BRAKE SERVICE IS REQUIRED</h3>
                    <p>The brakes on your Cadillac will sometimes alert you when they need maintenance. Whistling noises,
                        chirping sounds, and grinding are indications that brake service is required.
                        Here are some common causes of brake pedal pulsation and/or noise:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worn brake pads</li>
                        <li>Heat-cracked or worn rotors</li>
                        <li>Loose-fitting brake pads in the caliper</li>
                        <li>Missing or damaged noise insulators</li>
                        <li>Uneven torque of lug nuts or caliper hardware</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>BRAKE PAD WARNING INDICATOR :</h3>
                    <p>Vehicles often come equipped with a small,
                        thin piece of metal attached to the brake pad to act as a warning indicator when the pad material is getting low and the brake pads should be replaced.
                        This device makes a chirping noise on brake application, letting you know it is time to have your brakes serviced.</p>
